Intel(R) Memory Latency Checker - v3.10
Command line parameters: --max_bandwidth -l1024 

Using buffer size of 100.000MiB/thread for reads and an additional 100.000MiB/thread for writes

Measuring Maximum Memory Bandwidths for the system
Will take several minutes to complete as multiple injection rates will be tried to get the best bandwidth
Bandwidths are in MB/sec (1 MB/sec = 1,000,000 Bytes/sec)
Using all the threads from each core if Hyper-threading is enabled
Using traffic with the following read-write ratios
ALL Reads        :	8286.63
3:1 Reads-Writes :	6305.57
2:1 Reads-Writes :	8502.88
1:1 Reads-Writes :	10194.92
Stream-triad like:	8175.11
